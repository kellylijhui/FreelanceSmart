2. **AI Analysis** - The AI examines:
   - Quality and professionalism
   - Technical complexity
   - Time likely invested
   - Industry market standards
3. **Rate Suggestion** - Receive:

The AI considers:
- **Beginner** (CAD $25-50/hr) - Learning, building portfolio
- **Intermediate** (CAD $50-100/hr) - Solid skills, some experience
- **Advanced** (CAD $100-175/hr) - High quality, professional level

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: Is FreelanceSmart really free?**  
A: Yes! The entire application is free and open-source. The only cost is if you choose to use the AI Rate Advisor, which requires an OpenAI API key (typically costs a few cents per analysis).

**Q: Do I need to install anything?**  
A: No! You can use FreelanceSmart directly on Replit without installing anything. Just click "Run" and start using it.

**Q: Is my data stored anywhere?**  
A: No. All calculations happen in your browser. Your quotes, invoices, and contracts are generated on-the-fly and never saved to our servers. Your uploaded work samples are sent to OpenAI for analysis but are not stored.

**Q: Can I use this for my freelance business?**  
A: Absolutely! That's exactly what it's designed for. Feel free to use it to create real quotes, invoices, and contracts for your clients.

**Q: Can I customize the templates?**  
A: Yes! Once you copy the text, you can edit it in your email client or word processor before sending to clients.

### Pricing Questions

**Q: Why Canadian Dollars (CAD)?**  
A: The app was designed for the Canadian market, but you can easily adjust the currency or rates as needed.

**Q: Can I change the currency to USD or other currencies?**  
A: Yes! If you're running the app yourself, you can modify the currency symbols in the code. For Replit users, simply adjust your rates accordingly (e.g., if a CAD $100 rate equals USD $72, just enter 72 as your hourly rate).

**Q: What hourly rate should I charge?**

- Beginners: CAD $25-50/hr

### AI Rate Advisor Questions

**Q: How accurate is the AI Rate Advisor?**  
A: The AI uses GPT-5 (OpenAI's most advanced model) and is trained on vast amounts of market data. However, it's a suggestion tool - always use your judgment and consider your local market, experience, and client budget.

**Q: What images work best for AI analysis?**  
A: Upload clear, high-resolution images of completed, professional work. Screenshots of websites, photos of designs, portfolio pieces, etc. all work well.

**Q: Can I upload multiple images?**  
A: Currently, you can upload one image at a time. Upload your very best work for the most accurate rate suggestion.

**Q: Why did the AI suggest a rate that seems too high/low?**  
A: AI suggestions are based on the quality it observes in your sample and general market rates. Consider it one data point among many. Adjust based on your experience, location, and client type.

### Legal Questions

**Q: Are the contracts legally binding?**  
A: The contract template includes standard clauses used in freelance agreements. However, laws vary by location and situation. **Always consult with a legal professional** before using contracts for significant projects.

**Q: Can I modify the contract template?**  
A: Yes! In fact, you should customize it to fit your specific needs and ensure it complies with local laws.

**Q: What if my client disputes the invoice?**  
A: The invoice template is a professional request for payment but isn't a legal document by itself. Your contract (if you used one) is the legally binding agreement.
